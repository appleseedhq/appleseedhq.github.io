title: appleseed 1.5.0-beta Released
---

We are pleased to announce the release of appleseed 1.5.0-beta, the fifth release of our beta program and the 28th release overall. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/releases/tag/1.5.0-beta) for the full list of changes.

This release features significant improvements all around. In particular, we made interactive rendering considerably smoother, more responsive and more scalable on machines with many CPU cores. These improvements are available in appleseed.studio right away and will also benefit the next release of Gafferseed, the native integration of appleseed into [Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/), Image Engine's lookdev application.

This release also features numerous bug fixes, new features and performance improvements. Notable items include fixing some teething problems with the new glass BSDF introduced in the previous release, adding support for environment transforms (including motion-blurred environments), and making sure that textures referenced by [SeExpr expressions](https://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/seexpr.html) are now properly tracked by the project. The full list of fixes and features is available in the [release notes](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/releases/tag/1.5.0-beta).

As usual, this new release of appleseed is simultaneously available on Windows, OS X and Linux.

Massive efforts have also gone into developing appleseed-max, our native appleseed plugin for Autodesk 3ds Max, and we are happy to announce the immediate availability of [appleseed-max 0.1.8-beta](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed-max/releases/tag/0.1.8-beta) for Autodesk 3ds Max 2015/2016.
